# Coursify
A Hackathon Project that was used to learn while also creating something interesting!

This project attempts to show an example on how an AI assistant could help a student by creating their schedule and automatically populating the fields for the user!

Frontend uses vite react.

Backend uses Nodejs.

Database is mysql, which was hosted using Google Cloud's sql server.

AI was Open Ai's assistant.

A bunch of scripts were used to make this possible, which will be posted after!






# Issues we ran into and solved:
Connecting the Frontend and Backend!

AI assistant struggling to determine correct deparment/class values.

Database management and collection of class data and professor data!


# Frontend Packages
